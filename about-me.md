Hi there! My name is Owen Ruggiero. I'm a second-year graduate student at Loyola University Chicago pursuing a MA in Digital Humanities. In addition to my academic pursuits, I work with Campus Ministry's THEA Institute. THEA runs innovative programs for high school students that connect environmental sustainability and theology. I'm originally from Danbury, CT, and I've lived in Chicago for six years.
